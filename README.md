# Bonatics 

## Description

We created "Bonatics" for all plant enthusiasts who want to trade plants or discover new plants to add to their collection.  We want to create an online marketplace, similar to Etsy or Ebay to offer an alternative way of selling live plants. We know more and more people are interested in shopping for house-plants, but do not know what type of plants they should purchase or what is available.  Our website offers a space to discover what's available depending on the type of plant they're looking for and to expand their plant knowledge.
